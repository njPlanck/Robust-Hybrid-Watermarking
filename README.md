# Watermark Embedding Using DWT, DCT, and Arnold Transform
This project implements the algorithm proposed in the paper:

"A Novel Hybrid DCT and DWT Based Robust Watermarking Algorithm for Color Images"
by Ahmed Khaleel Abdulrahman and Serkan Ozturk.

The authors propose a robust color image watermarking method that combines:

Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)

Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)

Arnold Transform for scrambling

RGB channel separation and embedding

ðŸ“– Method Summary
Cover Image Preparation:

The input cover image is separated into its Red, Green, and Blue components.

Each channel undergoes a block-based 2D DCT.

The DCT-transformed channel is then processed using 2D Haar DWT to obtain four frequency bands (LL, LH, HL, HH).

Watermark Preparation:

A grayscale watermark is first scrambled using the Arnold transform (to increase security).

The scrambled watermark is binarized and then transformed using block-based DCT.

The DCT coefficients of the watermark are divided into four parts.

Embedding:

The watermark sub-parts are embedded additively into the four DWT bands (LL, LH, HL, HH) of the Red channel of the cover image.

(Note: The Green and Blue channels are not used for embedding in the current implementation, but can be extended.)

Reconstruction:

The watermarked DWT bands are inverse-transformed (IDWT), and then inverse DCT (IDCT) is applied to reconstruct the watermarked Red channel.

The final watermarked image is obtained by merging the original Blue and Green channels with the watermarked Red channel.
